    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
//    let age = 100;
//    let age2 = age;
//    console.log(age, age2);
//    age = 200;
//    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    //console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Dave';
    //console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //takes copy of original array
    team2[3] = 'Donnnnn'
    console.log(team, team2);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeeee haaaaaa';
    console.log(team4, players, team3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Dave Murray',
        age: 48
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
//    const captain = person;
//    captain.number = 99;
//    console.log(captain.number, person.number);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
        number: 99,
        age: 12
    });
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread .. no worky now .. ES7?
//    const cap3 = {...person};
//    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dave = {
        name: 'Dave',
        age: 100,
        // Object.assign will not go any levels deeper for 'social' info...
        social: {
            twitter: '@dmurraykauai',
            facebook: 'dmurray.dev'
        }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(dave);

    const daveCopy = Object.assign({}, dave);
    console.log(daveCopy);

    // poor man's deep clone -- might not be fast but works
    const daveCopy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dave));
    daveCopy2.social.twitter = '@boogie!';
    console.log(daveCopy2);
